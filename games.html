        <h1>"My" games </h1>
        <p>More like: games I worked on. Although I hope there will be a time where I created a game on my own.</p>
        

        <h2>Dying to Win</h2>

        <p><a href="https://rbastie.itch.io/dying2win" target="_blank">Dying to Win</a> is a game I made with some friends for a game jam back in October 2023. However, before this event I hadn't really gotten to know any of them all that well, so we weren't really friends yet.
        </p>
        <p>Before Dying to Win I had tried to create games on my own in both scratch and unity, but nothing playable ever came of it. This is the first time I helped to create a somewhat decent game.
        </p>
        <p>For the gameplay I mostly contributed by working out the gameplay loop and the player's limitations to keep it challenging. This was after <a href="https://itch.io/profile/pigwarbe" target="_blank">pigWarBE</a> had already conceptualized the gameplay. All my other contributions were in the design and audio department. So in the end I didn't write any code. Luckily <a href="https://rbastie.itch.io/" target="_blank">rbastie</a> and pigWarBE took care of this. I knew nothing of the Unity API so this was for the best, because there was no time for me to figure it all out. I came up with some levels (each level is a puzzle) and then <a href="https://itch.io/profile/j3st3rr" target="_blank">J3st3rr</a> someone else built them in Unity. Since he was constructing them he was also our play tester and iteratively redesigned the puzzles so they worked in-game. I also created some pixel art that wasn't already in the asset package we used. The ghost is an example of this. The track that loops in the background was composed by me. Since I made the music they let me do the sound design as well. I just searched for sounds on <a href="https://freesound.org/" target="_blank">Freesound</a> that would fit certain actions in the game. So I did a bit of everything, except for coding.

        <h2>Medieval Manager</h2>

        <p>I also worked on another game but we didn't finish it. This time I did help a little bit with the coding, but I still have a lot to learn. I made a camera controller, but my code was very sub-optimal and had to be reworked. <a href="https://timolde.itch.io/" target="_blank">TimOlde</a>, <a href="https://rbastie.itch.io/" target="_blank">rbastie</a> and I were working on it for the Week Sauce Game Jam of February 2024. You can still find <a href="https://discord.com/channels/948288413193363468/1203013806570217492" target="_blank">our post</a> for this Medieval Manager on the Week Sauce Game Jam discord server. Even though we never completed the game, I was able to compose the game's music.
