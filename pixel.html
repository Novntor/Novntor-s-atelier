        <p style="color:white">The following slimes were made for <a href="games.html" style="color:rgb(58, 123, 254)">the unfinished Medieval Manager game</a> and were based on a slime animation by <a href="https://timolde.itch.io/" target="_blank" style="color:rgb(58, 123, 254)">TimOlde</a>. The arms and the shield on two of the slimes are reused pixel art by <a href="https://rbastie.itch.io/" target="_blank" style="color:rgb(58, 123, 254)">rbastie</a> that he created for other sprites in the game.</p>
